# Once-in-a-lifetime
There will be a time where you have a desicion to make. One that you want to do, but cant bring yourself to do it. The fear consumes you. Even though you really want to move forward. You fear that you wont be able to make it. That you will fail at what your good at. That you will ruin the mood. That you will never go back. Its normal, But it dosent feel that way... does it?
